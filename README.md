# EPR-paradox

A data crunching/visualization module written in Python for use in a physcis laboratory. Specifically, **EPR-paradox** is used in quantum entanglement research to keep track of photon counts from two detectors, as well as coincidences (counts occuring simultaneously in both detectors). The data is visually represented in real-time with an accompanying GUI that shows plots of counts per second and allows the user to control the experiment, such as pausing the detections or changing the time interval at which they are recorded.
